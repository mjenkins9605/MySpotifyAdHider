# MySpotifyAdHider

Enjoy Spotify music. I use the webplayer and it is on seperate monitor. The ads banner changing distracts me so this Chrome Extension just hides it from view. This does not stop ads from playing after songs, just hides the banner.

Still working on getting the icon to show properly but not top priority. 

- Clone Repo

- Open Chrome, then extensions (chrome://extensions/)

- Turn on Developer Mode

- Drag and drop cloned MySpotifyAdHider folder into window

- Should be set

Manifest and CSS file are the important files. The PNG images are not necessary for this to work.
